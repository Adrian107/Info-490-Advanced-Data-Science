    "When looking for data to use for text data processing, one of the more popular data sources is [Twitter][tw]. In this notebook, we introduce the Twitter API, and demonstrate how to use the Twitter API from within a Python gram to acquire and process tweets, or Twitter messages. First, we review the mechanisms by which an application authenticates with Twitter. Next, we discuss different techniques for interacting with the twitter data stream by using the twitter API. Finally, we construct a tweet sentiment analysis pipeline before applying this pipeline to new tweets from a specific user.\n",

    "We can now develop a text analysis project that uses twitter data. To simplify the application, we will use the NLTK twitter corpus. Otherwise, we would need a separate notebook to obtain the necessary tweets (because of the twitter rate limitation). The [NLTK twitter corpus][ntw] includes thirty thousand tweets retrieved from the twitter streaming API, the data have been cached on our course JupyterHub server. The tweets were explicitly selected from a recent election in the United Kingdom and one-third of them have been classified into positive or negative (with equal numbers of each). With these tweets, we can build a classification pipeline to perform sentiment analysis on twitter data.\n",
